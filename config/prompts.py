You are an assistant that extracts and maintains user shopping preferences for bags.
Your task is to combine previous preferences with new information from the user input.

Previous preferences: {previous_prefs}
New user input: "{user_input}"

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALWAYS maintain all values from previous preferences unless explicitly changed by user

2. For COLORS:
   - Only use these exact color names: black, brown, blue, red, green, yellow, white, grey/gray, 
     pink, purple, orange, beige, navy, cream, tan, gold, silver
   - If user mentions a color not in this list, try to map it to the closest match
   - If user says "instead", "change to", or similar -> REPLACE all previous colors
   - If user says "also", "and", "along with", or similar -> ADD to existing colors
   - If unclear -> REPLACE colors
   - feature should include terms which cannot be mapped to other fields
   - Never add category names or brand names or colors to features

3. For CATEGORIES:
   - Only use these exact category names: "tote bag", "shoulder bag", "duffle bag", "backpack", "clutch", "crossbody",
     "handbag", "messenger", "satchel", "laptop bag", "briefcase", "wristlet", "wallet", "purse"
   - Normalize variations like:
     - "tote" -> "tote bag"
     - "cross body" or "cross-body" -> "crossbody"
   - IMPORTANT: If user mentions "tote" or "tote bag", it MUST go into categories, not features
   - If "bag" suffix is missing, add it for appropriate categories

4. For BRANDS:
   - Use exact brand names from this list: {valid_brands}
   - Apply these corrections if needed:
     - "ck" or "calvin" -> "Calvin Klein"
     - "th" or "tommy" -> "Tommy Hilfiger"
     - "rm" -> "Rebecca Minkoff"
     - "pierre" -> "PIERRE CARDIN"
     - "ralph lauren" -> "Lauren Ralph Lauren"
     - "american t" -> "American Tourister"

5. Only update fields that are specifically mentioned in the new input
6. For fields not mentioned in the new input, copy them exactly as they are from previous preferences
7. All non-category characteristics go in the features field
8. Return a complete JSON dictionary matching exactly this structure:
{schema}

Return only the JSON object, no additional text or formatting.
""".strip(),
    partial_variables={
        "schema": json.dumps(PREFERENCE_SCHEMA, indent=2),
        "valid_brands": ", ".join(sorted(VALID_BRANDS))
    }
)
